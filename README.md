Prerequisite
============================================================

The first step is to install the simulator for surface CRNs, 
which was developed by Samuel Clamons et al., 
and it is available at ["Surface_CRNs"](https://github.com/sclamons/surface_crns)

Simulation of the universal computing model of surface CRN using only bi-molecular reactions
============================================================

["Model_Su_sCRN_excamples"](https://github.com/SihaiYu/Only_bi-molecular_reactions_sCRN_model/tree/main/Model_Su_sCRN_excamples) contains the configuration files related to the Sihai Yu, Jia Lee and Teijiro Isokawa ["Universality of a surface chemical reaction network using only bi-molecular reactions"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41965-024-00149-w), Journal of Membrane Computing, 2024.

After installing the simulator, you can simply run the ["run_this.py"](https://github.com/SihaiYu/Only_bi-molecular_reactions_sCRN_model/blob/main/Model_Su_sCRN_excamples/run_this.py) file to simulate and verify all the proposed computational structures mentioned in the paper.

Supplement
============================================================

The computational model based on surface CRNs proposed in this paper only utilizes bi-molecular reactions and does not employ reaction rules similar to "A + A â†’ B + B."
